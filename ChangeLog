	* Other:

2007-11-14 Emmanuel Saracco <esaracco@users.labs.libre-entreprise.org>

	* Encryption:

	  - PRS is now able to encrypt/decrypt itself on request. What you
	    have to do is just encrypt it with a secret key (using tools
	    available in the "encryption/" directory), put the encrypted
	    file on a remote server and request it by passing it your secret 
	    key using HTML POST method (see the "post.html" file). It is
	    a ugly/lame/experimental feature, so take it as a PoC and play
	    with it :-) Do not hesitate to send me ideas or patches!

	* PHP:

	  - Now take in account "open_basedir" PHP configuration variable.

2007-11-12 Emmanuel Saracco <esaracco@users.labs.libre-entreprise.org>

	* Self-recovery:
